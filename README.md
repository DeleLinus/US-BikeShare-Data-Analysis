# 'US-BikeShare-Data-Analysis'
United States Bikeshare data analysis is a capstone project for a Data Science Internship program at Wejapa. 
This is a project that make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City,
 and Washington. It contains code that imports the data and answers interesting questions about it by computing 
descriptive statistics. Also, there's a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the 
terminal to present these statistics.

## Usage
The project is set up as a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive
experience in the terminal that answers questions about the dataset which comprises of  data related to bike share systems for
three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
The experience is interactive because depending on a user's input, the answers to the questions on the previous
page will change! There are four questions that will change the answers:
1. Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
2. Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
(If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
(If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or
Sunday?

## Authors and acknowledgment
A special thanks to the Wejapa Interneship organisers, most especially my very own mentor, George Sam for his guidance
and review throughout the course of the internship.
